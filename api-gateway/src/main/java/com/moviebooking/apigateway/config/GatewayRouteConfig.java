/**
 * ============================================================
 * Gateway Route Configuration
 * ============================================================
 * WHAT: Defines routing rules that map incoming API paths to
 *       backend microservices. Also configures per-route
 *       rate limiting, circuit breaking, and request rewriting.
 *
 * WHY Code-Based Routes vs YAML Routes:
 *       Both approaches work in Spring Cloud Gateway.
 *       Code-based routes are used here for complex routes that
 *       benefit from type safety and IDE support.
 *       Simple routes are in application.yml for readability.
 *
 * WHY Kubernetes Service Names as URIs:
 *       In Kubernetes, services are accessible via their DNS name:
 *       http://{service-name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local
 *       Using lb:// prefix enables Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
 *       to resolve to Kubernetes endpoints, providing:
 *       - Native K8s service discovery (no Eureka needed)
 *       - Automatic failover when pods are unhealthy
 *       - Rolling update compatibility
 *
 * WHY Rate Limiting at the Gateway:
 *       Protects ALL downstream services from DDoS and traffic
 *       spikes with a single configuration point. Each user
 *       (identified by X-Authenticated-User header) gets their
 *       own rate limit bucket (Token Bucket algorithm via Redis).
 * ============================================================
